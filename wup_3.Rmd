```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```
## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
boxplot(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
``` 
  
  
  the boxes are not disjointed. The back box median is higher than the front and middle box. The front and middle box are similar in size but there are more out liars in the middle box 
  
## Numerical Summarys 

## Inferential Tests

## Conclusions
